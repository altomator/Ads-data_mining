# Data mining illustrated ads with object detection

This work is a compagnon project of the GallicaPix PoC. It has been conducted during the 2019 Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon, within the Newspapers and Capitalism [group](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/digital-humanities-hackathon/category/newspapers-and-capitalism/), and thanks to the [NewsEye](https://www.newseye.eu/) European project.

It leverages a dataset of heritage French newspapers illustrated ads built under the [GallicaPix](https://github.com/altomator/Image_Retrieval) umbrella:
